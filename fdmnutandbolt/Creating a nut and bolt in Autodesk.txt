Creating a plastic or nylon nut and bolt in Autodesk Fusion

Modify->Change Parameter, define the following user parameters:

bolt_diameter, e.g. 16mm
thread_clearance, e.g. 0.5mm
thread_section_size, e.g. 2mm
coil_height, e.g. 14mm

Nut hole size:
bolt_diameter + (thread_section_size*2) + thread_clearance

Defining the coil for the nut hole:
Diameter = bolt_diameter + thread_section_size + thread_clearance
Revolutions, e.g. 6
Height (length of the coil), e.g. coil_height
Section = Triangular (Internal-threads facing inward)
Section Position = On Center
Section Size = thread_section_size
Operation = Join

Define the entrances to the nut hole:
Use a Solid->Box to remove the thread that stick out beyond the edge
Use a Solid->Teroidal with the inner size of the diameter at the bolt_diameter and teroidal diameter at 1mm 
Modify the outer edges with a fillet at 1mm to smooth the entrance


Bolt size:
bolt_diameter

Defining the coil for the bolt:
Diameter = bolt_diameter
Revolutions, e.g. 48 (multiples of the nut)
Height (length of the coil), e.g. coil_height
Section = Triangular (External-threads facing out)
Section Position = On Center
Section Size = thread_section_size
Operation = Join

Define the point of the bolt:
Use a Solid-Teroidal the inner size of the diameter to the bolt_diameter and teroidal diameter at 5mm
Modify the outer edges of the point with a fillet at 1mm to smooth the point
